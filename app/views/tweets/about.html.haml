    Isn't it great meeting new Ruby friends at conferences, Ruby brigades,
    meetups, hackathons, or wherever?

    Wouldn't it be great to share that new friendship? Now you can! Just
    snap a pic of you and your new friend(s) together, tweet it with
    hashtag #ChefFriends, and we'll include it on the site here.
